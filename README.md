## About

This project is about bridging the educational gap in local communities across Africa, in line with goal 4 of the Sustainable Development Goals where access to good education is strongly limited due to this cause. By supplying such communities with qualified school teachers, we will be giving members of those communities, both old and young access to quality education that will positively impact their economy and welfare.


## Why

We have come to realize how poor many local, especially rural, communities are in the African society, and one very common factor between these communities is the lack of proper education amongst the populace.

Although some of these communities might have had to government or Non-governmental Organisations come to their support in terms of food or infrastructural facilities that end up getting obsolete quickly because of lack of maintenance, their lifestyle and economy have experienced no significant growth.

To battle this terrible situation, the best support that could be given these people is the power of an educated mind. Many of these communities have schools that are poorly equipped, some void of teachers or students, many children going out to sell commodities, offer services, while supporting the livelihood of their families at the cost of the own personal development.

With an army of well trained, experienced and financially supported teachers, more families will be encouraged to get educated, grow and impact their communities in ways they never could imagine.


## Usage

- Teachers signup
- Teachers get trained and certified
- Teachers get deployed
- Teachers have acces to communicate with other stakeholders like the governing body of the programme
- Teachers have access to educational resources


## Setup

Install `npm` or `yarn` if you dont have any of them already installed. We recommend Yarn though.

After clonning the repo to your local machine and moving into the cloned folder, Run `yarn install` to get started by installing dependencies. 

`src/index.js` is the entry to the project and source code should go into the `src` folder.

All tests should be written in the `__tests__' folder. There's a sample in there.

This starter uses [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/getting_started.html) as the bundler. It is much simpler that WebPack and the others

#### Hints

- Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to get started. We'll assume you are using Yarn.
- Install additional dependencies: `yarn add <dependency-name> [-D]`
- Run tests: `yarn test`
- Run tests with test coverage info: `yarn test:cover`
- Check the codebase for proper syntax and formatting compliance: `yarn lint`
- Run your app in local dev mode: `yarn start`. This puts the bundled app in a `dist` folder, set up a local web server at localhost:1234, and continues to watch for your code changes which it syncs with the local server. This means if you loaded the app in a browser, it will auto-refresh as you code along. Feel free to use whatever bundler best meets your needs. Parcel was only added as a sample and for those looking for a simple but effective solution to the hassle of bundlers.

## Contributing
If this project sounds interesting to you and you'd like to contribute, thank you!
First, you can send a mail to buildforsdg@andela.com to indicate your interest, why you'd like to support and what forms of support you can bring to the table, but here are areas we think we'd need the most help in this project :
1.  area one (e.g this app is about human trafficking and you need feedback on your roadmap and feature list from the private sector / NGOs)
2.  area two (e.g you want people to opt-in and try using your staging app at staging.project-name.com and report any bugs via a form)
3.  area three (e.g here is the zoom link to our end-of sprint webinar, join and provide feedback as a stakeholder if you can)
